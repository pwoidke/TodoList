TDD vs. ATDD â€“ What, Why, Which, When & Where?
Daniel Davis

Discussion over presentation
principles over prescription

Would you rather build the thing right or build the right thing?

TDD: Test driven development
	writing tests before writing any code
	ensures code is thoroughly unit tested

ATDD: Acceptance test driven development
	tests are written by the testers or stakeholders before coding
	ensures code reflects desired outcomes

BDD: Behavior driven development
	ATDD but tests are written by the developers

All of these use the red, green, refactor practice

Why do we want tests? Protection from...
	scope creep
	missed requirements
	changing requirements
	goldplating (building more than is needed)

Why test
	help build in small, incremental, iterative steps
	supply us w/ fast feedback and more direct path to failure points
	protection from changes in the future
	living documentation that changes w/ the system
