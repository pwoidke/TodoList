PPOs
look at manager goals, grab items you directly support, break them down further (how do i support these)
also things that manager can help support for me
-coll/search lead
	-DOMS/CICD/Prod
-what other things do I want to work towards this year
-utility work?
-model validation (fixtures from flagship-api)
-Behavior testing team?
-APIs (depending on what Nat's plans are) (probably need a group to review APIs/JSON schema SME)
Think about what Brian can work on/what I want Brian to work on/interested in/what he wants to work on/etc.
Anything I support will be in PPOs too

Growth path:
diff b/w lead and lead architect is how 15% capacity is allocated (w/ Nat vs w/ processes/people)
which am i most interested in
I can switch whenever
Manager: not introducing new stuff, but building off of it
focus on what i like and what i'm good at and how i can use that to contribute to the team

maybe create API subteam?
create braintrust for API meetings we've been having

let sam know if there's anything that should go on Cory's PPOs






PPO meeting
