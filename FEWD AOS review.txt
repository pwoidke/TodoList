no +/- to 2016 because first time FEWD-only

Customer 100
Focused 86: good, but want to know how to get better
Fast 100: ci/cd allowing us to get faster
Frugal 57: Flat to BU
	re-doing specs because of changing requirements
	not accurately logging time
	difference b/w what we're doing and how long it takes
	rework/pivoting/build something that ends up not being needed
	taking too much time for planning/meetings/tools
	efficient use of time?
Curiosity 86: 
Expectations 86

Bigger team 71: -2 to BU
	Working with MGT/CMS, no interaction besides passing issue, answering questions
	Working in silos w/o clarity about what we're all working towards
	progress via shared components, playbook
inclusion 86
Feedback 71: -7 to BU
	Tech lead vs manager
Development 86
feel valued 100
great place 100

All very positive

no visibility to overall goals
too much time making things "perfect", left with no time to iterate
no visibility to other teams
align w/ partners on deadlines
reporting structure does not converge (it does, but it doesn't really help)
other paths for growth besides managerial/architectural
	developer: delivers code
	leads start taking on managerial/architectural responsibilities
	beyond that, you don't develop, you help remove obstacles for others
	Very linear career path, from jr dev to stopping point
	Vlad/Alex exploring flat structure, how to continue incentivizing devs
documentation subteam

AOS Champion
focus on 1 action item for improvement
AOSC owns the action item and works towards progress
Meet next week to talk more about it and action plan
select from top 3 opportunities for improvement

	create living document for touchbases

----

Focus on Frugal
Allocate 1 hr/week for team to review plays
duplicative/throwaway work
There will always be throwaway work
	-Had to start over on winter CI/CD work for DOMS
Can we use FEWD scrum more effectively?
	Only report on site-wide changes
Survey team re: pain points
	this week or next week
Email
	focus area: frugal (time efficiency)
	plan for brainstorming of action items (survey)
	timeline

----

FEWD survey/Brainstorm solutions

Small group to brainstorm issues
survey which action item you want to do

People don't have visibility to how things will be used
	Devs focus too closely on something unimportant or miss critical requirements
	Need use cases for development tasks
Add reviewers when a spec is actually ready for review to cut down on tasks to do

focus less on rework, more on frequent communication of changes

Ensure notifications are handled so that everyone can see them and is aware of changes
	FEWD blog


----

Blog guidelines
	Short
	Relevant
	Keep up to date?
		link to updated docs in confluence and/or code in stash
	What should get a post?
		Major updates
		Maybe minor updates
		No patches
	First post should announce blog guidelines and reasoning/intent behind them
		Link to play for how to set up outlook filter rules
	Who should post?
		FEWD leads/Squad captains to start
		Expand if needed/wanted
Aim fo 8/25 for first post
	Missing piece is the "why?"s
	Explain why we're doing what we're doing
		Why just leads/captains?
		Why post what we post
