Collection API notes

--Move collection ID to properties from definitions
	Nope
--Change collection.cmsComponentContainers and/or collection.product.stacks.cmsComponentContainers for simplicity
--Add stacks to collection-facets/sort
'altPrices' may be a string, depending on promotion engine

How does filtering work w/ filterable trait vs additional endpoint
	Use traits on additional endpoint
--'isPriceReduced' needed?
	YES: New savings flag (change property name to clarify)

questions:
--What does collection ID look like?
	Remove from response. Not needed since it is in the URL
Stacked collection headers: all features, text features only, or name & description data
facets: 'isAvailable' needed at facet level, or just option level?
	Keep: May be used in the future
Product - do we need color?
	Yes: Filtered w/o color image shows photo + swatch

How do these traits actually work?
Do I need RAML files for each schema, or each endpoint?


append collection id, generic id, size code, color code
Do breadcrumbs need to return to sorted/filtered collection? If so, do we need to include those params in the URL?




How to handle browser/breadcrumb back for an updated collection
Confirm new saving flag comes from CMS

Color units (comes from CMS through filters)

Add to Collection API:
	Strikethrough price (Property: salePrice)

Error handling?
