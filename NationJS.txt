Talk 1 - The Intelligence of Instinct by Emily Freeman
Soft skills
Follow your instincts
Don't commit stuff if it feels wrong
Brain makes speed/accuracy tradeoffs
Brain has 2 ways of thinking: Type 1 = Emotional, Type 2 = Logical
System 1 is unconscious and processes information quicky

Trigger your system 2: Ask questions

Talk 2 - How to Build a UI That Can Live Forever by Laurie Barth
Problem: 1000s of devices that do motion control, all with different configurations. Need a single UI

Can't keep up with board updates, so API driven by board itself. Used to create UI elements.
Board gives a structure that says what it is (JSON file)
