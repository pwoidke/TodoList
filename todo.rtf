Today is Wednesday, May 27th:

Use "unit test" subtask in estimation

Shirt size and assign as a group
Subtask and estimate points individually
Junior dev gets a 2-pt task, expect it to be done in a week
Challenge to do TDD on one subtask

points = # days * ~70% / experience
estimate = points * (1 / % of known requirements)
