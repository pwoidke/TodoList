Today is Friday, March 27th:

Technical Issue VSBACKLOG-19407 Fragrance Finder / Snap Points not adjusting on tablet to view entire page

BUILD - Front End VSBACKLOG-18739 Fit Quiz / After signing in, user is not returned to the Fit Quiz results page to see the PIN for the BRAFIT offer

Add check to disallow saving looks with same name
Add limit to length of name of saved swim look
Improve removal of unavailable products: Delete look if all products removed

Should we remove quantity from saved look buy all update quickview? Probably.

MVC presentation?

Pull out FF animations and implement separately

Create tasks for fragrance finder migration
	Set up confluence page

VSBACKLOG-16419: As a customer I want my size to be saved and auto-selected when I use the "How To Measure" feature.
	VSBACKLOG-19443: Add AJAX call to calculator button event
	VSBACKLOG-19444: Add function to select calculated options in quiz from How to Measure overlay
		Add cross-origin receiver in fit quizzes
		Add cross-origin trigger in calc

Group pricing tasks:

	S - set up new page(s)
	M - set up routing (based on fit quiz MVC implementation)
	S - nav between product set pages
	M - product set pages

	? - edit set after add to bag

		S - send updated selections

Questions:
