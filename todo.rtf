	https://confluence.victoriassecret.com/display/VSDP/VSDP-7059:+Login+Security+API+Contract
Third party logins:
	Endpoint loads blank page, FE adds login code?

Account Sign In GET request could be static page?
Recognized state? BE has to tell us. That would be a GET as well
GET request to blank JSP and inject login markup with HBS, update endpoints

Forwarding:
If going to account landing page directly, presented with login page, forward to page at login
Add forwarding URL to response
