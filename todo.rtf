Collection/Search onboarding:
2015:
	Jupy/sticky filter on collection pages
	Mobile 3-grid test
	0-attribute (atb from collection if only qty, mainly beauty), shared with product team (JSP tag)
	Don't own overlays, atb, quickview
	Own add-to-lovelist, KWS, collection, catalog quick-order (display, click order)
	GEFOC, lovelist stuff, response product image grid/fluid grid
	Facet data converted from obj to arrays
	Rechrome, certona on collection, WCAG
	Currently get markup back on filter (will eventually be JSON like BCF)
	KWS
Upcoming
	KWS, enhancements
	Product display (stuff below images on coll page)
	3-grid enhancements
	Redo lovelist someday (collection as "rack")
Search
	Search should look/feel like collection (data is completely different)
	Slightly different filtering on search/collection (We'd need to own improvement, REI has code to maintain state)
	Search functionality is all in fabric
Desktop filter A/B test (moving filters from top to side)
Start on visual KWS issues
Check in w/ Devs if taking long time to make progress
Clovis has school Tue/Thurs
Cycle checkins - Every week, 30 min. / dev
Jeremy owns Metrics tagging, product grid, save scroll position, search: desktop facet menu styling, layout, no results page
Nick owns autocomplete, search form
Clovis owns T65 (moving filters to side)
Third party stuff - KWS (Adobe), search input (jsnav)
Adobe > templates > designs (mobile/html/adobe-search/*.tmpl)
KWS Code:
	search form component
	search bar is same on header and search page, container owns search overrides
	facet menu, sort, and search page are components
	fab-facet-menu_desktop.js ln 31 (update state)
	facets are headers, facet options are options (onClickFacet ln 42)
	form-search: submitSearch ln 65 sets hash, but should be a broadcast to search to set the hash (update route function), open/close panel ln 132 can be updated to use UU.watch
	search component (fab-search_mobile.js): 
	search.jsp holds the components
	product = 240px wide
	module_fab-fixed-menu_desktop.js: controls positioning of side facet menu
	fab-search_desktop.scss loads stylesheets for search page
Collection code:
	fabric/components/collection has full-row-adjustment, product-view, etc. (dumping ground)
Backend/remote/third party resources - Parveen, rikesh, molet (50%)/Sachin & Tony WCAG/Wall-E Adobe, Sachi Adobe dev
