rx.js = observable library

variables hold data, but sometimes the data isn't there yet (servers, etc.)
promises tell us a var will have data eventually
single value/sync = variable/async = promise
multiple values/sync = array

observables = multiple pieces of data over time
ex: button clicks

use .subscribe to unwrap
	myObs.subscribe(someClickEvent => processClick(someClickEvent));

**observables represent a collection of values delivered over time**

Why are observables important? Let's build a stopwatch
stopwatch has 3 data sources over time: start button clicks, stop button clicks, time increments
use functional programming to update values (ex: converting integers to tenths)
[1, 2, 3].map( x => x * 2); // [2,4,6]
tenthSecond$
	.map(item => item / 10)
	.subscribe( num => resultsArea.innertext = num);

button events:
let startButton = document.querySelector('#start-button');
let startClicks$ = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(startButton, 'click');
startClick$.subscribe(() => {
	// update results
});

Same solution can be used for
	dran n drop
	loading bar
	chat room
	etc.

Everything is a stream
of events
delivered over time

still some hard things:
Netflix search w/ typeahead
requests can come back out of order
solve: add random variables to track state, add state awareness to server, etc. :(
	OR just use observables

// functional programming is boring magic
