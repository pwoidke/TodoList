Build squad SVG work:
Move loader tasks back to flagship
Integrate w/ asset build task
Comment in ticket why we're doing it
	loader not needed\\\\
	centralize code
	easier to run/test
Added Build Flagship SVG to Bamboo UAT job (bamboo.lbidts.com)


SVG build:
what repo/branch: flagship/FEWD-198-asset-build
how does it work now: task build svgs for fabric-catalog, index.html pulls in data-icons as path to svg sprites and brastrap makes ajax requests
how will it work: recreate build-svg task for webpack
	if webpack can call our function, output them directly into dist, good to go
what are next steps: research plugin

webpack.config.js
repo: build-svg > index.js ("buildSVG")

do we do anything with custom build?
fabric-catalog > src/package.json: "build":"build-svg" (ln 10) (broken)
icons is referencing elements, but files are under components (should be under elements like in flagship)
	fabric-catalog > index.html paths are broken (ln 18)
flagship > package.json: "build-svg"

use "npm run build:svg" to run build job

check plays and meet w/ brian to walk through stuff

in webpack.config.js,
webpack.js.org/configuration (rule.loader)
Line 26:
module: {
	rules: [{
		test: \/.svg?$/
	}]
}
use "npm run build" to run


Meeting w/ Brian:
SVGs are only in sprites
sprite gets compiled separate of middleware (build then serve)
want to include in "npm start", but hasn't because no new SVGs
inline styles allow for more granular styling
inline branch in build-svg in index.js
do we still need critical and common (and credit card) svgs separately?

Publish and install loader:
new repo
publish
branch asset build
add package
add to webpack config

npm i --save new-plugin
npm i --save-dev new-plugin
