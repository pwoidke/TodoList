Todo Today (11/8):

--Open JIRA ticket for RITA for last items spanning full width on mobile

Add twitter meta tags
Update social share code based on BE response
Update nav template to support different types of features

Add tickets for tasks based on Nat's Confluence page
Move other tickets to C1



Code quality is key
Make deletable code

Fabric++
	Review features w/ Nat
	Determine next steps (refactor, config, product component, etc.)

Love List
	Add feature to empty list

At some point we will need to decouple the drawer and mobile facet menu so that it doesn't require a click in the styleguide

Update Love List to use UU.watch()
