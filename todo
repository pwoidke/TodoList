Moving layouts/grids into Fabric
What can't be moved into components? Features? Anything used in multiple places?


Boutique questions:
Do we have different sort/filters on different tabs, or do they carry over? -Probably not
Do the preference selectors stay the same as they are now?
Lazy Load vs. Load More button
No pinned filter bar
Save scroll position -No
Brand filter (tabs) pin to the top on scroll
Zero results?
Show tab based on where she's coming from
How do we get Preference selections to update results?


Love List
Add feature to Love List header (maybe expose share dialogue, maybe something else) (VSDP-28042)
Update email
Update social post data
Add reminder to select attributes when sharing (VSDP-28176)
Only content is updating (not the controls)

Questions:
	Are the ftl files the correct templates for the LL emails? (yes)
	Do we need to do anything special to update them? (VSDWEB process)
	Can we show Love List items in the email? (availability, restrictions, etc.)
	Do we need to do anything special to update social stuff? (no)
	What does a recipient see if items are no longer available on a shared LL? (normal LL)
	Where does the shared LL page code live? (see ticket)
Compare w/ product share on PDP


Standardize the "page" template (decommission #wrapper, replace with layouts)
elements > components > patterns (variations with regular culling)
how to have different versions/variations/extensions
where do features belong
Extend: multiples break it
Variations: Duplication, inconsistency
Configure: heavy, complex
Is there a time where the context in which a feature exists should influence it?

Decommission #wrapper
Layouts: full-width, group row, grids
Fabric masthead/footer
Subtasks by EOD Friday
I am doing VSDP-28465 - Rich media components


Touchbase
Can we check time on the FE to control functionality?
