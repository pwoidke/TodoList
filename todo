Todo Today (10/7):

FE C9 review meeting @ 3pm


Moving layouts/girds into Fabric
What can't be moved into components? Features? Anything used in multiple places?


Boutique questions:
Do we have different sort/filters on different tabs, or do they carry over? -Probably not
Do the preference selectors stay the same as they are now?
Lazy Load vs. Load More button
No pinned filter bar
Save scroll position -No
Brand filter (tabs) pin to the top on scroll
Zero results?
Show tab based on where she's coming from
How do we get Preference selections to update results?
