Todo Today (10/12):

Code quality is key

Set up subtasking meeting w/ Jeremy


ForeSee POC

update window.location

-Can't reproduce


Moving layouts/grids into Fabric
What can't be moved into components? Features? Anything used in multiple places?


Boutique questions:
Do we have different sort/filters on different tabs, or do they carry over? -Probably not
Do the preference selectors stay the same as they are now?
Lazy Load vs. Load More button
No pinned filter bar
Save scroll position -No
Brand filter (tabs) pin to the top on scroll
Zero results?
Show tab based on where she's coming from
How do we get Preference selections to update results?


Love List
Add feature to Love List header (maybe expose share dialogue, maybe something else) (VSDP-28042)
Update email
Update social post data
Add reminder to select attributes when sharing (VSDP-28176)
Only content is updating (not the controls)

Questions:
	Are the ftl files the correct templates for the LL emails? (yes)
	Do we need to do anything special to update them? (VSDWEB process)
	Can we show Love List items in the email? (availability, restrictions, etc.)
	Do we need to do anything special to update social stuff? (no)
	What does a recipient see if items are no longer available on a shared LL? (normal LL)
	Where does the shared LL page code live? (see ticket)
Compare w/ product share on PDP


Standardize the "page" template (decommission #wrapper, replace with layouts)
elements > components > patterns (variations with regular culling)
how to have different versions/variations/extensions
where do features belong
Extend: multiples break it
Variations: Duplication, inconsistency
Configure: heavy, complex
Is there a time where the context in which a feature exists should influence it?

Decommission #wrapper
Layouts: full-width, group row, grids
Fabric masthead/footer
Subtasks by EOD Friday
I am doing VSDP-28465 - Rich media/content/feature components

Moving things around, filling in gaps (inconsistent documentation)
We should know what can be configured in CMS and code/test to it
Ex: Dynamic text/video/product selection all represent CMS, but have different configuration options view


Set up breakout session w/ Nat
document what feature overrides exist in Collection/Search
type, name, responsive, configurable

Make a static thing first (no JSON)

Ex subtasks:VSDP-28464


Touchbase
Can we check time on the FE to control functionality? (Test dimension?, check w/ Nat)


Fabric
Techniques
	extending/embedding partials (markup embedded on page)
	classing (class specifies layout)
Attributes (brand, device, template)
	adaptive (new files for each version)
	responsive (same markup for different attributes)
	variation/subcomponents (conditionally change behavior based on attributes)
Configuration
	CMS sets feature data (video: controls, loop, etc.; dynamic text: copy location, font, etc.)
API
	What you need to use the piece of fabric (JS require/HBS embed)

Each component is a Node package
The abstract is the Masthead
The variation is none/checkout/third-party/etc.


VDay priority
Email 2.5
Social 1.5
Add Feature 3
Dependencies: MGT (feature), UX (comps/copy)


Fill in destinations for non-fabric components
