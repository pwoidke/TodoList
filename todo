Todo Today (1/23):

Supermodel API:
Edit, Version, Use
Next:
Continue converting JSPs and document properties, logic, conditionals, etc.
Build schema for image
	Try swagger, json-schema.org

Rachel:
	Check H&L Button stuff: Is it still in-progress
	Status of unit testing and next-up's

Thursday (1/26): FEWD team meeting: Discuss interesting CodeMash stuff

Alex is sending proposals Re: conversion





TODO:
--Check VSDP-28189 - Can reproduce, looks like we're still not getting facet menu data. Sandeep is checking BE.
	Update: Adobe is breaking when we send cookie values

JIRA tickets for viewer
add to settings pane:
	variations: runway model: supermodel

api/models/feature/
	_model.json // supermodel
	image.json // runway model
		runway model contains $refs to properties in the supermodel

in components/feature/image/fixtures/linked-image.json
	add schema: "api/models/feature/image.json"
	use this to validate

how to show supermodel in styleguide so that it relates to the component/variation you're on?


Dynamic Text meeting 1/24:
Determine meaningful variants




Todo:
merge in work Cory did
Identify properties he added
figure out why those were added and what we should do with them
Add reducer to styleguide (adapts api model to whatever component needs)
hook up validation based on fixture schema property

review w/ leads on Thursday

New stories:
	Add reducer (adapter) so we can convert fixtures into view models
	As a FEWD I want the supported Fabric Image component variants to comply with the image schema
	As a FEWD I want a fixture validation job that tells me when my fixture does not match its schema

Add under styleguide: "/models/module.js" to handle logic (currently in styleguide/module.js)

Todo:
Display json
Highlight runway model properties in supermodel (and display with little connector lines maybe?)
Add display for description, etc. in json





call w/ michelle, craig, molly 1/25

send michelle email with last day and resignation letter
michelle will send me exit info

		may want to set up meeting w/ WCAG team to determine requirements and design specs
Brian:
unsure bc no time to meet w/ nat, changing reqs
scenarios vs varients
	arrays vs JSON objs to construct varients
