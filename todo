VSDP-25992
FE: media query for max-width that sets text size/position using mixin from H&L
Update mixin to use percentage/pixel values instead of viewport units
Mobile only (desktop is done)
Use case: Collection headers, floating cues (span 100%)
Max-width 480px
We get the base dynamic text component from H&L?


Alt images:
What is the ask?
Why can't it be done in the JSP?
How will FE get the data?

If show ai when switch is on,
if filter by color or when code has primary image code in DIVA,
C6: can set image type in DIVA and we show images based on specified type
C7: If collection image is set, we should show the alt images in the carousel
For coll w/ view type, we should override rules to show AI carousels
Image logic is all in the JSP, BE moving to controller to send to FE


Anthony: Find out where we make call to tell Certona what products were displayed to the user
