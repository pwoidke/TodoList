Lead things
	Don't horde information
	Plan so that everyone knows everything (generally) that needs to be done
	Visibility and reporting of status
	Rely on your devs and encourage them to call out issues (prevent spin)
	Lean on your PA/PO for information, call out blockers
	Assume that people know what they're doing (until they give you a reason not to)
	Schedule meetings if you're having trouble getting information from people
	Create documentation
	Review (execute) PRs to ensure confidence in your team's code
