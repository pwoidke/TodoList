Love List
Add feature to Love List header (maybe expose share dialogue, maybe something else) (VSDP-28042)
Update email
Update social post data
Add reminder to select attributes when sharing (VSDP-28176)
Only content is updating (not the controls)

Questions:
	Are the ftl files the correct templates for the LL emails? (yes)
	Do we need to do anything special to update them? (VSDWEB process)
	Can we show Love List items in the email? (availability, restrictions, etc.)
	Do we need to do anything special to update social stuff? (no)
	What does a recipient see if items are no longer available on a shared LL? (normal LL)
	Where does the shared LL page code live? (see ticket)
Compare w/ product share on PDP


VDay priority
Email 2.5
Social 1.5
Add Feature 3
Dependencies: MGT (feature), UX (comps/copy)


VDay TB w/ Ryan
Empty lovelist (no share buttons), should we hide feature or show a different state?
On desktop, header/share buttons pin to top on scroll
On click feature, open share (or share replaces feature)
Unpin header bar
Mobile: tap feature, show options overlay

Refactor:
remove pinned header
remove border update on share open


TODO Love List:
Confirm no custom feature functionality
Router state set on image link click


Requirements, Specs, Comps:
MVP:
Feature on LL (DIVA-managed)
Email content
Social content
Content should be removed on specific date
BE:
Add header feature to page
Update JSPs (email/social data) to integrate w/ DIVA
FE:

Remove pinned nav (done)
(add feature to page via feature data in JSON?)
Show different feature for empty list, list w/ items, shared list
	- Render all 3, hide them, FE shows applicable feature based on data
	- (CMS could set up conditional feature to handle this functionality)
DIVA>Social: CMS>Thursday
Social content comes from BE in pagedata
Email content comes from BE via ftl templates
On recipient view, hide feature if list is empty
Ryan: Getting alignment on MVP for displaying features

Can we set/overwrite facebook share stuff?
FB pulls opengraph tags from the Love List page

CMS (Rachel) needs a list of everything that should be configurable in DIVA
Email
	header image
	main image
	footer image
	text 1/2/3
Social
	image
	text
		FB
		Twitter
		Pinterest


Review 10/26:
Image will be updated on the DIVA side, URL will stay the same
