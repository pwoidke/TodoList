Love List
Add feature to Love List header (maybe expose share dialogue, maybe something else) (VSDP-28042)
Update email
Update social post data
Add reminder to select attributes when sharing (VSDP-28176)
Only content is updating (not the controls)

Questions:
	Are the ftl files the correct templates for the LL emails? (yes)
	Do we need to do anything special to update them? (VSDWEB process)
	Can we show Love List items in the email? (availability, restrictions, etc.)
	Do we need to do anything special to update social stuff? (no)
	What does a recipient see if items are no longer available on a shared LL? (normal LL)
	Where does the shared LL page code live? (see ticket)
Compare w/ product share on PDP


VDay priority
Email 2.5
Social 1.5
Add Feature 3
Dependencies: MGT (feature), UX (comps/copy)


VDay TB w/ Ryan
Empty lovelist (no share buttons), should we hide feature or show a different state?
On desktop, header/share buttons pin to top on scroll
On click feature, open share (or share replaces feature)
Unpin header bar
Mobile: tap feature, show options overlay

Refactor:
remove pinned header
remove border update on share open


TODO Love List:
Confirm no custom feature functionality
Router state set on image link click


Requirements, Specs, Comps:

(add feature to page via feature data in JSON?)
Show different feature for empty list, list w/ items, shared list
	- Render all 3, hide them, FE shows applicable feature based on data
