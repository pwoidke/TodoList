VDay TB w/ Ryan
Empty lovelist (no share buttons), should we hide feature or show a different state?
On desktop, header/share buttons pin to top on scroll
On click feature, open share (or share replaces feature)
Unpin header bar
Mobile: tap feature, show options overlay

Refactor:
remove pinned header
remove border update on share open


TODO Love List:
Confirm no custom feature functionality
Router state set on image link click
