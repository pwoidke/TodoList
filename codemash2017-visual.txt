Picture This: Automated Visual Regression Testing
Jeff Koenig

TheJefe.github.io/picture_this/

why do we need VRT
	Browsers are inconsistant
	too many environments to test manually
	testing is boring

Why aren't we all doing it?
	bad tools (meant for other things)

VisualReview
	server based, requires manual review of diffs
Spectre
	server based, pass/fail, still needs manual review
Wraith
	headless browser, compares screenshots, but only for headless browser
Selenium Wraith
	works in selenium, compares all browsers to same baseline image, some weird cropping/resizing (1 master image)
Resemble.js
	really good image-differ, but that's it
PhantomCSS
	headless, focuses on CSS regression testing

Problems w/ tools
	requires more infrastructure
	requires completely separate test framework
	only work well for static sites
	must use real browsers to be effective
	No clear test result (pass/fail)
	difficult to use w/ CI

Compatriot
	focuses on taking and comparing screenshots, ruby-based
	tests are similar to unit and integration tests
BrowserStack
	Paid, tons of browsers, API for automated tests

Control Images
	tests store control images and use them as basis for comparison

Image diffing
	Jeff Kreeftmeijer - pixel by pixel image comparison function
	Pass/Fail = Assert diff < threshold (ex: 0.05%)

Tests are slow, but can be parallelized

Retries reduce noise from page rendering speeds (ex: retry once on fail)

Variable data generation
	ex: names, usernames, etc.
	hardcode data for tests

Things to fix
	browser drivers are inconsistent
		full-page screenshots
		inconsistency with driver support
		JS events (hover, etc.) work differently
	use ResembleJS for better diffing
