Filters
options: local storage, cookies, user session (BE), browser session, url params, api
old prod: filters are stored in session for any collection (each colln saved separately)
local storage size limit: limit to most-recent 5 or 10?
can't use cookies, can't use session

passing to pdp:
BE build and FE just updates it
Update schemas to get selections and build on the FE

get more info from sheel to confirm if we can persist only most-recent collection (not all)

account requirement to clear saved facet values
	save a LS item with all saved keys that should be cleared on sign-out?

Check how much data is saved if facets are saved in LS (5MB limit)
Will there be any kind of user ID in config?

save in LS:
	collection ID or path + user ID(?)
	selected facets
		key:value1,value2

Session LS:
	saved keys: [ collection ID or path + user ID(?) ]

load from LS:
	get LS data from key
	for each facet, if key matches key, set values to selected

on sign-out:
	loop through session LS keys
		clear values
