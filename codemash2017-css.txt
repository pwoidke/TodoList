BEM - Block__Element--Modifier
	Started at Yandex to help w/ code structuring and reuse
	Syntax, architecture, semantic, methodology

Naming conventions:
	B__E--M
	B_E-M
	Consistency is what matters
	Note that single requires camel-casing to distinguish hyphenated selectors

Semantics: Developer vs HTML/CSS semantics

Methodology: makes it easier to figure out how things work

// Ah, shoot, I already know all of this

Block: The shell; highest level of a component

Element: Child of a block

Modifier: Represents a different state of the element

Design a system of components, not pages

Be specific about what the class is supposed to be styling

Separate Skin & Structure
Separate Container & Content: Style based on descriptive classes

Methodologies
	Atomic Design
	SMACSS (Scalable & Modular Architecture for CSS)
	OOCSS
	inuitCSS

Take away's
