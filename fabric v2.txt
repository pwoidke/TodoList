Standardize the "page" template (decommission #wrapper, replace with layouts)
elements > components > patterns (variations with regular culling)
how to have different versions/variations/extensions
where do features belong
Extend: multiples break it
Variations: Duplication, inconsistency
Configure: heavy, complex
Is there a time where the context in which a feature exists should influence it?

Decommission #wrapper
Layouts: full-width, group row, grids
Fabric masthead/footer
Subtasks by EOD Friday
I am doing VSDP-28465 - Rich media/content/feature components

Moving things around, filling in gaps (inconsistent documentation)
We should know what can be configured in CMS and code/test to it
Ex: Dynamic text/video/product selection all represent CMS, but have different configuration options view

document what feature overrides exist in Collection/Search
type, name, responsive, configurable

Make a static thing first (no JSON)

Fabric
Techniques
	extending/embedding partials (markup embedded on page)
	classing (class specifies layout)
Attributes (brand, device, template)
	adaptive (new files for each version)
	responsive (same markup for different attributes)
	variation/subcomponents (conditionally change behavior based on attributes)
Configuration
	CMS sets feature data (video: controls, loop, etc.; dynamic text: copy location, font, etc.)
API
	What you need to use the piece of fabric (JS require/HBS embed)

Each component is a Node package
The abstract is the Masthead
The variation is none/checkout/third-party/etc.

Fill in destinations for non-fabric components
