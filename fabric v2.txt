Standardize the "page" template (decommission #wrapper, replace with layouts)
elements > components > patterns (variations with regular culling)
how to have different versions/variations/extensions
where do features belong
Extend: multiples break it
Variations: Duplication, inconsistency
Configure: heavy, complex
Is there a time where the context in which a feature exists should influence it?

Decommission #wrapper
Layouts: full-width, group row, grids
Fabric masthead/footer
Subtasks by EOD Friday
I am doing VSDP-28465 - Rich media/content/feature components

Moving things around, filling in gaps (inconsistent documentation)
We should know what can be configured in CMS and code/test to it
Ex: Dynamic text/video/product selection all represent CMS, but have different configuration options view

document what feature overrides exist in Collection/Search
type, name, responsive, configurable

Make a static thing first (no JSON)

Ex subtasks:VSDP-28464

Fabric
Techniques
	extending/embedding partials (markup embedded on page)
	classing (class specifies layout)
Attributes (brand, device, template)
	adaptive (new files for each version)
	responsive (same markup for different attributes)
	variation/subcomponents (conditionally change behavior based on attributes)
Configuration
	CMS sets feature data (video: controls, loop, etc.; dynamic text: copy location, font, etc.)
API
	What you need to use the piece of fabric (JS require/HBS embed)

Each component is a Node package
The abstract is the Masthead
The variation is none/checkout/third-party/etc.

Fill in destinations for non-fabric components


Template: The Page
Layout: Relation to the window
Grid: Relation of content to layout


Feature Breakout Session Questions:
	What are all the different types of "rich media components"? Products, features, anything else?
	Single feature component that works for anything or different components for each type of feature?
	Single configurable product component or many variations?
	Are there examples on the site where features are rendered on the FE?
	How do we link features to markup? Feature IDs?
	How do we control/account for feature sizing set in DIVA?
	How do we dictate what product to show?
